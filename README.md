# Pig Dice

#### An exercise to practice the new concept of prototypes version 15/8/2020

#### By Alan Wickham

## Description

The game is dice game.  Roll as often as you like and add up the rolls, but if you roll a 1 you get zero and the die is passed to the other player. The first to 100 wins.

Using prototypes allowed the variables associated with each player to be easily passed from function to function.

## Known Bugs

The winner alert doesn't actually end the game.  Need to work out how break works, currently all it does is stop the program from running.

It would be good to introduce a pause between computer rolls.  For some reason the method used to make a pause between the computer turn ending and the score display being reset doesn't work.  Something about being inside a loop, but even referring to a function outside the loop doesn't work

When a player rolls a 1 it would be good to reset the score display after a period of time.  Should be straightforward, but on the to do list.
